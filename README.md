How To Use This Role
--------------------

**Products**

This role is built around enabling the Red Hat products you have a subscription entitlement to. For each product or product group listed it will:
  - enable the product repository
  - create a content view or composite content
  - publish the content view to Library
  - create corresponding activation key
  - create a sync plan

**Subscriptions**

By default activation keys are created without any associated activation keys.
You will need to edit ```defaults/activation_keys.yml``` with your subscription details for each activation key you want created.

For convenience, the variable *default_subscription* can be set instead of editing ```defaults/activation_keys.yml```. This is useful if you have an subscription or a subscription that bundles lots of products like the one use in the example below.

**Installation**

```
ansible-galaxy install git+https://github.com/flyemsafe/satellite-day-two-ops.git
```
Example Playbook
----------------

**Create your first ORG and upload a manifest**

This example will create and download the manifest required for Satellite. You will need a subscription pool to continue with this example.

How to find your subscription pool:

1. https://access.redhat.com/management/products
2. Click on your product
3. Select the subscriptions Tab next to Overview
4. Select the subscription number
