## This task file is a work around to redhat.satellite.redhat_manifest always downloading
## the manifest. There needs to be a way to detect when the downloaded manifest is new
## to only trigger an upload to Satellite. If the manifest is not new the upload of an
## existing manifest results in the task failing.
